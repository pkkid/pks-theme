# PKs Theme

Fork from Simple Dark Theme with my own customizations. Added Python utility to more
easily find and update colors without needing to navigate a massive JSON or XML blob.

### Customization

```
    "workbench.colorCustomizations": {"[PKs Theme]": {}},
    "editor.tokenColorCustomizations": {"[PKs Theme]": {}},
```

### Publishing

```bash
$> vsce package
$> vsce publish
```
